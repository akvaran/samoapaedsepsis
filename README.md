Epi Info 7 template for Samoa Paed Sepsis project

# OVERVIEW
This is the Epi Info 7 project file associated with the forthcoming study on paediatric sepsis prevalence and time-to-antibiotics at Tupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital, Apia, Samoa. 

These files should be used in conjunction with Epi Info 7 (CDC, Atlanta), free available at: 
https://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo/pc.html

A copy of the check code used for the project is available in a separate document, as well as embedded within the project file. 

I welcome any adaptations of these files. You can contact me at aiden [dot] varan [at] gmail [dot] com for further information. 

Thanks,
Aiden
